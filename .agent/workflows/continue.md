description: Resume work on the current in-progress task, or pick up the next one if finished.

1. Read your specific backlog file (e.g., `directives/01_backend_backlog.md`).
2. **Check for In-Progress Tasks**: Look for any item marked as `[/]`.
   - **If Found**: This is your current focus. Analyze what has been done and propose the immediate next step to complete it.
3. **If No In-Progress Task**: Look for the first item marked as `[ ]`.
   - **If Found**: Mark it as `[/]`, read related files, and propose an implementation plan (same as `/start`).
4. **If No Tasks Remain**: Congratulate the user and ask for further instructions from the Manager.
5. In all cases, confirm your understanding of the task before writing code.
