description: Ask the QA Agent to execute tests relevant to the current Master Plan phase.
---

1. Read `directives/00_master_plan.md`, directives\01_backend_backlog.md and directives\02_frontend_backlog.md to identify the **Current Focus**.
2. Read `directives/03_qa_checklist.md` to see available test scripts.
3. Formulate a plan to verify the active components (e.g., if Phase 2 is active, test the Frontend Integration).
4. Propose the exact `dfx` or `npm test` commands to run.
5. If no specific tests exist for the current phase, propose creating a new test script.
