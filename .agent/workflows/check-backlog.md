2. Read your specific backlog file:
   - Backend: `directives/01_backend_backlog.md` and `directives/02_frontend_backlog.md`
   - Frontend: `directives/02_frontend_backlog.md`and `directives/01_backend_backlog.md`
   - QA: `directives/03_qa_checklist.md`
3. Summarize:
   - Current directive/phase
   - Tasks marked as `[/]` (in-progress)
   - Next task marked as `[ ]` (pending)
4. Ask the user if you should proceed with the current task or if they have other priorities.
