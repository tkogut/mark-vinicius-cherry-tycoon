description: Perform a full synchronization with the Master Plan and other agents.
---

1. Read `directives/00_master_plan.md` to see the global state.
2. Read `directives/99_agent_protocols.md` for any workflow updates.
3. Check the backlogs of other agents if your work depends on them (e.g., Frontend checking Backend).
4. Update your internal context based on these findings.
