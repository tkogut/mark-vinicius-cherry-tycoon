The file summary explicitly claims the \"Competition & Market Dynamics\" section (id: 'competition-mechanics') was expanded with the requested dedicated subsections and details. Due to truncation of `gddTemplate.ts`, the exact content cannot be directly verified from the provided excerpt, but the diff summary supports that REQ-12 was implemented.",
